Well I was hacked on December 15th and found out before Christmas. I can't remember what day exactly because I try to forget the theft ever happened. It was a psychic blow. I lost over 1 BTC and a two (2) parcel decentraland estate that was worth 8,000 MANA.

I feel that security is the way forward. My lastPass was hacked. They got into my OneDrive and found my seed phrases. With that they transferred all the tokens I had in my wallets then moved to my exchanges to remove funds from there too. It is and has been a nightmare. My credit is frozen. My credit cards have been replaced. I had to change all my passwords and to top it off I need to switch my password manager too.

Wow I made it! Today I accepted the role of "Associate Software Engineer"!! Finally my work paid off. I won't lie it has been a long road and I had all but given up. This was a do-or-die year (figuratively) for me. In true Tre' fashion I threw a few irons in the fire and worked hard. I should have focused but it was hard to give up on my dream. I also couldn't see how I would pay my bills with other work like Reiki or Yoga.

I am surprised that I don't have more words about this but stay tuned. My fire is ignited again. Thank you universe!

Life is beautiful! I have been coding during the day and learning from a senior developer. It is amazing! I want to take time and journal what advice was helpful and what advice wasn't. I don't have time now but it is coming soon. I say you should definitely code as much as possible. Always be learning

Things are great. I am still able to code all day at work. I love it. We have challenges but each day is a little easier than the last. My biggest obstacle at the moment is my team. Not everyone is trying as hard as I am. I worked with this team before and the same thing happened there. I set a goal for myself to be team development lead. I am not there yet but it felt like where I would like to be in the future.

As part of this goal I decided to work with the team to help unblock them where I can.

Today I am over the moon about my job! I am so happy to be coding all day. Each morning we have a sit down and learn from our tech lead. I am also happy to be working with a team. Real engineering and coding is about working with a group and forming teams. This is definitely making me a better communicator and a better developer.

A few months ago I was promoted at work from high level tech support into an associate software engineer with a global real estate company. If you have been reading my life then you know this has been a dream of mine since 2003, I just didn't know. It took me from 2003 until 2014 to realize I am a software developer and NOT I.T. (information technology). Everyone said I was IT but I think that is because they were not used to seeing a person of color as a software developer. 

Unfortunately not knowing who I was in the beginning cost me valuable time and energy. If I had unerringly followed the software development path I went to school for, and not been side tracked, I would be a tech lead or more by now. But I had to make it through the side door. I networked, worked hard, and listened to advice from 2014 to 2019. The last bit of advice I got that I feel helped me make this move was to work for a "Software Company". I had been in government forever but that wasn't getting me where I wanted to be. Working in a software led to more opportunities in the field I am most passionate about. I didn't know a thing about real estate but I do know software.

Life is wonderful. Here I have spent years talking about my path to becoming a software developer. Recently I have been changing my focus to keeping the job. P Diddy expressed the idea in [this video](https://youtu.be/OU8KksjGB8s). I spent so much time chasing the dream I wasn't focused on keeping the dream once I *caught it*. 

Now that I am working as an engineer my focus is teamwork and visible progress. Each project, task, and feature I get it working, then get it working right, and finally making it work fast. Those 3 steps have improved my approach to tackling difficult code. I also end the day on a "high note". I avoid starting difficult task the last hour of work. Instead focusing on "wrapping up". Making sure the code pushes and I have noted all Jira tickets.

My other focus as an engineer is to continue learning. I am currently being asked to know 3 new languages for my day job. I am focusing on React and NextJS but I still need to incorporate Red Hat Linux, Ruby, AWS, and Docker. Currently Pluralsight tutorials are in my daily routine.

On the weekends I am also creating a portfolio Open Source Software (OSS) project called [Tanda DAO](https://github.com/Trewaters/Tanda-DAO). It is a cryptocurrency peer-to-peer lending platform. Currently it isn't coded yet but I have submitted it to the [ETH Denver hackathon](https://www.ethdenver.com/). I earned a [Camp Buidl POAP](https://app.poap.xyz/token/6513719) certificate for my work.

Keep grinding! Keep learning! Keep coding!
Share your work and help others! 

I will not fear coding!
Fear is the app-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings a total meltdown.
I will face my code with a clear mind and a steady hand.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only the clickity clack of my keyboard will remain.

Work has been full of learning and growth opportunities. 

The biggest challenge I have at the moment are my team members. I have members on my team that aren't carrying their weight. We are all new in this role, so I understand we are coming from various backgrounds. If you have been reading then you know I have been awaiting this moment of years. They on the other hand are not trying as hard.

Developers told me that teamwork is important in coding. I am learning that first hand. I have never loved teams because most people don't care as much as I do. Teams are flawed in that credit goes to the leader and not always the one the deserves the credit for their work. Quaterback was always my example. Who are the other members of the "team"? Few people look at the entire team, just the leader(s).

In an effort to "have a better attitude" I am doing my best to lift them up instead of complain about them. I want to succeed but I am sure that I need to do it with them. It doesn't seem productive for me to develop code Alone and not push it to the common repo. They on the other hand will work for a long time on a feature and never push their work for others to review. I try to show by example that it is helpful and necessary to update the code often. Seek help if you are stuck. I do.

We all must work together as a team to get this code out the door. I hope my team can improve. I am doing my best to help them. I am also doing my best to not complain about them. I worked with them in my previous role and I know they are lazy. I work as hard as I can because I care about the products I produce. They get away with whatever they can when the boss isn't looking. Very frustrating.

I am losing my point but the tl;dr is use ALL opportunities to grow. This is my chance learn how to be a tech lead. My goal now at 48 years old is to become a software engineering tech lead. This seems like a good opportunity to develop that skill.

The past couple of weeks have been busy. I completed my first sprint as an engineer! That was exciting. Now we are working on our project as the rest of scrum team is formed. My team is starting to work harder as more managers and figures of authority start to interact with us in meetings. When no one was monitoring us closely we all worked slower. But that meant my already under performing team members were not putting any real effort into learning the code. I on the other hand keep hammering through obstacles one way or another. Our recent roadblock was connecting to a new external API. This took us about a month. None of the mentors nor my team had the time, or ability to get this data from the external API. Finally yesterday I cracked the code, literally. I was able to write code that would display API data on the website. The code looks baisc and follows worst practices but it runs. The rules are:

1. Get it working.
2. Get it working right.
3. Get it working faster.

I am on #1. Get it Working.

Other milestones are having our official tech lead for the dev team. Last week we onboarded our scrum master. Things are coming along great. Next week I will demo my work for our first ceremony. I am in heaven! Everyday I am excited for what the day has to bring. My working rules are to not work on difficult problem as the day ends. Stopping hard issue one (1) hour before the day ends. It helps me avoid obsession on an issue that is wasting my brain cycles. If I have an issue that is blocking me I write it down on a list or peice of paper and keep it close so I can revisit that technical issue later when I have time to learn and study. It has helped me put things to the side. The secondary benefit is the ego boost I get from looking at those notes and tearing them up because I know how to do that now. For example loading json files into my NextJS project as mock data. That beat me up one day now I know how to do it.

Growth is good thing. I strive for it everyday.

We are in Sprint 2 now. Technically we started with Sprint 0, so this feels like my 3rd sprint but it is only our 2nd official one. Plus we still don't have all the ceremonies started. Lots of us are learning as we go. Our Scrum master is experience but others in the group are also doing their jobs for the first time. I still enjoy waking up every day to work. With all my enthusiasm I am trying not to over work. The work they pay me to do is so inspiring that I could code from morning until night but I also have life going on around me. Work isn't the only thing I do. I am a father, husband and healer. There is so much I have to balance in order to satisfy all the demands of my life. I don't mind the responsibility but in order to succeed I must find balance. Each day isn't perfectly balanced, but I am trying.

I share this journal to be a role model for others. I know there are few black people in the software development field. I'm usually one of the few black folks in the developer meetups I attend. It would have helped me in college or earlier to know that more people like myself were developers. I was doing graphic animations with my friends Garret and Jeff in 1992 at CSU computer lab. That was fun for me. We were animating a space ship and it would take all night to render. I also used computers a ton back in the 80's. I was the only kid I knew with a Commodore 128 in 1984.

It took a long time to find a job as a software developer. It took many hours of working hard for no money. Early mornings of coding and late nights in San Francisco at tech meetups. Now I am still learning. The work I did before this job prepared me to get started but there is more to learn. Being a developer is more than the code. I am now having to learn how to scrum. That isn't something I practiced before this job. I heard about it but never dived deep into it... until now.

Today it has been 6 months since I accepted a role as associate software engineer. Before starting this role, I thought I knew a lot already. Now that I am in the role it was apparent that what I knew was enough to get "Started"!? 

Building enterprise software has been eye opening. I work on a dev team that reports to daily scrum meetings. Completing 2-week sprints and being asked to do something new each time. This is a true growth period, and I am Loving every minute of it. Now it has shifted my code study from part-time to daytime. I no longer stress myself about coding on the weekends, in the early-mornings, or after work. I still follow topics in tech, but I am getting 8 hours of code a day (if I want it) so I am full each day.

My current goal is to document what I have learned. Put together some type of knowledge base (blog) that helps assert my expertise. I am learning a ton but it is great to have a place to point people that don't know me. So, they can see what I have been doing and what I have learned.

I also need to create a portfolio piece to show my peers and prospective employers. 

More about life later. Thanks for reading.

Creating a learning path. Feeling like I am stagnating a little. The work isn't enough to teach me since we are on tighter deadlines.
