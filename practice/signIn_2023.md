Well I was hacked on December 15th and found out before Christmas. I can't remember what day exactly because I try to forget the theft ever happened. It was a psychic blow. I lost over 1 BTC and a two (2) parcel decentraland estate that was worth 8,000 MANA.

I feel that security is the way forward. My lastPass was hacked. They got into my OneDrive and found my seed phrases. With that they transferred all the tokens I had in my wallets then moved to my exchanges to remove funds from there too. It is and has been a nightmare. My credit is frozen. My credit cards have been replaced. I had to change all my passwords and to top it off I need to switch my password manager too.

Wow I made it! Today I accepted the role of "Associate Software Engineer"!! Finally my work paid off. I won't lie it has been a long road and I had all but given up. This was a do-or-die year (figuratively) for me. In true Tre' fashion I threw a few irons in the fire and worked hard. I should have focused but it was hard to give up on my dream. I also couldn't see how I would pay my bills with other work like Reiki or Yoga.

I am surprised that I don't have more words about this but stay tuned. My fire is ignited again. Thank you universe!

Life is beautiful! I have been coding during the day and learning from a senior developer. It is amazing! I want to take time and journal what advice was helpful and what advice wasn't. I don't have time now but it is coming soon. I say you should definitely code as much as possible. Always be learning

Things are great. I am still able to code all day at work. I love it. We have challenges but each day is a little easier than the last. My biggest obstacle at the moment is my team. Not everyone is trying as hard as I am. I worked with this team before and the same thing happened there. I set a goal for myself to be team development lead. I am not there yet but it felt like where I would like to be in the future.

As part of this goal I decided to work with the team to help unblock them where I can.

Today I am over the moon about my job! I am so happy to be coding all day. Each morning we have a sit down and learn from our tech lead. I am also happy to be working with a team. Real engineering and coding is about working with a group and forming teams. This is definitely making me a better communicator and a better developer.

A few months ago I was promoted at work from high level tech support into an associate software engineer with a global real estate company. If you have been reading my life then you know this has been a dream of mine since 2003, I just didn't know. It took me from 2003 until 2014 to realize I am a software developer and NOT I.T. (information technology). Everyone said I was IT but I think that is because they were not used to seeing a person of color as a software developer. 

Unfortunately not knowing who I was in the beginning cost me valuable time and energy. If I had unerringly followed the software development path I went to school for, and not been side tracked, I would be a tech lead or more by now. But I had to make it through the side door. I networked, worked hard, and listened to advice from 2014 to 2019. The last bit of advice I got that I feel helped me make this move was to work for a "Software Company". I had been in government forever but that wasn't getting me where I wanted to be. Working in a software led to more opportunities in the field I am most passionate about. I didn't know a thing about real estate but I do know software.
