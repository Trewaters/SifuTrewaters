Well I was hacked on December 15th and found out before Christmas. I can't remember what day exactly because I try to forget the theft ever happened. It was a psychic blow. I lost over 1 BTC and a two (2) parcel decentraland estate that was worth 8,000 MANA.

I feel that security is the way forward. My lastPass was hacked. They got into my OneDrive and found my seed phrases. With that they transferred all the tokens I had in my wallets then moved to my exchanges to remove funds from there too. It is and has been a nightmare. My credit is frozen. My credit cards have been replaced. I had to change all my passwords and to top it off I need to switch my password manager too.

Wow I made it! Today I accepted the role of "Associate Software Engineer"!! Finally my work paid off. I won't lie it has been a long road and I had all but given up. This was a do-or-die year (figuratively) for me. In true Tre' fashion I threw a few irons in the fire and worked hard. I should have focused but it was hard to give up on my dream. I also couldn't see how I would pay my bills with other work like Reiki or Yoga.

I am surprised that I don't have more words about this but stay tuned. My fire is ignited again. Thank you universe!
