- 5/3/2018 Thursday, Preparing for success. Updating early. If I don't update this in the morning I have a tough time getting back to it. Tonight is SF Node May! My first time helping out.
- 5/2/2018 Wednesday, updating in the evening. I almost missed my update. Bumpy start to the challenge but moving forward. I went to Waffle.JS tongith and had a great time. I met some people I know. I need to be less shy when I run into people. I didn't say as much as I wanted to.
- 5/1/2018 Tuesday, Time to dust off some cob webs and do a GitHub challenge. Post on this GitHub for 30 days. Coincidentally this is starting on May 1st. That should make it easier to track.
