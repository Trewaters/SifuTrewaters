- 2/24/2017, Good Morning
- 2/25/2017, Good Morning. Going to meet Winston for :coffee:.
- 2/26/2017, Afternoon. Working on final exam for MongoDB University! Oh boy this is a challenge!
- 2/28/2017, Finished the MongoDB class! Woo Hoo! That was a bit of a challenge. Time was against me for the workload. Now I will pivot to another project. Time to put effort into shopping app. Tinkering all the time. :honeybee: -soulfire
- 3/1/2017, I got an offer I couldn't refuse while working on the "Am-Fresh" app my wife and I thought of. Boy do I like to over extend myself! 
- 3/2/2017, Tonight is an SFNode meetup. Should be fun.
- 3/6/2017, Missed a couple of days of practice and that is disappointing. I am trying to do as many days as possible using the GitHub katas. Happy Birthday! Today I am the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy answer to everything. Feels pretty good.
- 3/8/2017, Going sailing today. Open up the NativeScript page to see what it has to offer.
- 3/9/2017, Having issues installing NativeScript on my Windows 8.1 machine. pain in the arse. Most of it is installed but some last part is broken :confounded: !
- 3/10/2017, Got to love coding for this answer. I got into NativeScript when there was a breaking change from Android SDK. Android moved things around so that I was doomed to fail. Luckily there was I got an answer to my dilema from Stack Overflow! :sunglasses: :computer: :heart:
- 3/12/2017, Missed a day due to friends visiting. Taking a break today. We will see what happens. :hatching_chick::hatching_chick::hatching_chick::hatching_chick:
- 3/15/2017, Last night I watched a show called "Abstract" on Netflix and I really enjoyed it. He commented that artist should draw everyday. I agree with that. Programming is the same way for me. I need to program everyday to keep myself sharp. I also need to work harder if I find there are parts of my skill set lacking! :bowtie: :muscle: :checkered_flag:
- 3/16/2017, Tired today and woke up late. Trying hard to make my daily github update! Yay! I have almost committed! 
- 3/17/2017, Working hard to do my daily kata. Position 2 Github Kata.
- 3/18/2017, Found an organization online that calls itself CoderDojo. So funny how you get reminded that no "great" idea is unique or REALLY new. Berkeley Javascript Dojo (BJD) is not the same, nor is it inspired by CoderDojo or CodeWars. I will look into each of these more. I envision BJS as a seed that will grow into more meetups. The format is location-language-Dojo. The group will set up regular meetings. Create Katas for users to practice and improve. Create a way to communicate, we use Slack in our Dojo. Each user must participate to be considered a member of the Dojo. Membership is free because knowledge should be shared, not hoarded. There is more too it but that is all I feel like writing down at the moment.
- 3/19/2017, Realized I can't get any real coding time if I don't wake up early on the weekend. Splitting my time between family and coding takes deliberate action. Time to look into the NativeScript tutorial some more.
- 3/21/2017, Forgot to do an update yesterday. Seems like I will be sarting over again. Teaching myself a lesson. When I do 30 days in a row I will be in a good place! :muscle:
- 3/22/2017, Went to MongoDB meetup last night in San Francisco. That was fun. I got to ask questions of some of the internal team. I also met a nice guy from Aspen. Time to try some new meetups. I have been going to the same topics for awhile and they aren't as interesting as they once were. I feel like it is more marketing. I want more inspiration.
- 3/23/2017, Almost forgot to update today. I was inspired to add my notes for a politcal app on github. I figure I have 4 years of inspiration under the new administration. 
- 3/24/2017, It's Friday!!!! :star:
- 3/25/2017, I'm at the monthly BJD (Berkeley Javascript Dojo) meetup. I am on time and no one is here. 3 people said they would attend during the 4 hour block. We will see how that goes. Consistency is important for me as the host. Even if they don't show I will.
- 3/27/2017, Daily practice! I forgot to push my updates from home computer OR I forgot to do my daily katas. I thought I was on it doing my daily katas but I can't be sure. Now I am at work and there is no way to know until I get home. But this will give me a chance to see what happens when someone updates a repo and then someone else tries to update the same repo later. Hopefully Git merges the old updates with mine... not sure till I try it :smiley:
- 3/28/2017, At Working trying not to forget my Kata for the day. Last night I did some github work on multiple repos and that felt good. Looks like the practice is paying off. [ Day 2 of 30 ] :high_brightness:
- 3/29/2017, Didn't start the day coding. Waking up at 5 am shouldn't feel like cheating. Going to bed at 10 pm was the real problem. Excited to play with Angular 4 this weekend. I added some notes to the BJD github page. [ Day 3 of 30 ] :muscle:
