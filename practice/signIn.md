- 5/5/2017 Almost missed this. Happy Cinco De Mayo! I woke up later than I really wanted to. I am making this post after work. Thank goodness it is getting done but sleeping in isn't an option. If I want more sleep I need to go to be earlier. At least for the next 30 days.
- 5/4/2017 Yesterday I got a call from an old client for help. Looking at the application I created for them I forgot how much I have accomplished. That was years ago and it still works great for them. You need to remind yourself sometimes of your accomplishments. They feel I can move the earth and sky. I feel like I am not as good as I want to be. Too funny :laughing: [ Day 4 of 30 ]
- 5/3/2017 Making my commit early. I am sure this is the only way to make sure I can fulfill my commitment! Inspirational rap I found today Qbala from Fort Collins Colorado is still producing music. She has this song I ran across and I think the message was pretty clear ( https://youtu.be/RXbPzrV3cvo ). Great song for the day. [ Day 3 of 30 ]
- 5/2/2017 I don't know if I made a post on 4/30/2017, but I am 99% sure I updated the document and didn't do a `git push`. I will find out next time I update from home. I don't want to psych myself out thinking about it. I have felt so strongly about making this the THIRTY (30) day challenge! (later that same day) I got home and checked my computer. The time stamp on the working folder showed 4/30/2017 but when I did my `git pull` there were no conflicts. and April 30th was not in my notes. That really fucking FUCKING sucks. I was really ready to kick some ass on this round. I just want to cry. I can do the work but my commitment isn't there or something. I can't seem to go more than a week without fuck FUCK FUCKING IT UP and missing a day. I don't usually miss more than one day but the honor goal is 30 straight days. I just want to cry, but instead I bought some absinthe. Not going for a bender, just a little on the rocks to soothe the pain of loosing/failing once again. I want to code for a living so this must happen. :muscle: [ Day 2 of 30 ]
- 5/1/2017 I am making another post today. Reading about cryptocurrencies a lot. Daily routine helps sharpen the craft. Getting excited about more javascript katas. [ Day 1 of 30 ]

Failed to make my daily committment... again. Working on accepting the failure and trying again!!! Fall on your back so you can see up and get up!
:anger:

- 4/29/2017 Kia! [ Day 8 of 30 ]
- 4/28/2017 Sun phase is almost over. Pieces sun is hard sometimes. Today is Friday! Woot Woot. Time to get my butt into gear. I have been looking into `stdout` and `stderr`. Looks pretty interesting. [ Day 7 of 30 ]
- 4/27/2017 Again didn't do this update first thing. I almost forgot about it. That was close and familiar. This is how it seems to happen a lot. I get wrapped up in the every day or whatever and then I forget to do my updates. Ridiculous. Gotta get my head in the game if I plan on making this work... [ Day 6 of 30 ]
- 4/26/2017 I didn't do this in the morning and it has been a struggle to remember to do it the rest of the day. Shouldn't be that hard to do. Now it is done and off my plate. I agree that morning is the best time for me to do this before the madness of the day washes it all away. I am working on a few javascript exercises to keep me fresh and frosty with my code. The github kata is working so well that it is past time to create more katas!! [ Day 5 of 30 ]. 
- 4/25/2017 Woke up late but making my update anyway! [ Day 4 of 30]
- 4/24/2017 Doing this update in the mornings is the best approach for success [ Day 3 of 30 ]
- 4/23/2017 Tomorrow this needs to be the first thing I do in the morning. [ Day 2 of 30 ]
- 4/22/2017 Lost my focus and didn't update every day. [ Day 1 of 30 ]

- 4/19/2016 Working on a different way to present the Dojo.
- 4/18/2017 I am starting over. The weekends are my enemy! [ Day 2 of 30 ] :bow: :japanese_ogre: :new_moon:
- 4/17/2017 I am feeling rather crushed. I don't think I did an update on Sunday. I am at work so I can't check. Hopefully I have a commit on my home computer waiting to be pushed. That would still count for the challenge. I am posting anyway. I will check my home machine and hope there is a gift waiting for me! [ Day 1 of 30  ]

starting over... "from the top" :sob: :weary: :heartbeat: :fire: :runner:
30 Days of GitHub here I come!
---

- 4/15/2017 No one showed up to the BJD meetup. I only had myself and one other person RSVP yes. But that person didn't show up and I decided to do some work on the GitHub repo while they weren't here. Make the most out of my time. [ Day 9 of 30 ]
- 4/14/2017 So tired today. Too many days in a row of staying up late. [ Day 8 of 30 ]
- 4/13/2017 Almost forgot to update! That was close. I really want to make the 30 days in a row of updates. [ Day 7 of 30 ]
- 4/12/2017 Making an update before it gets too late. This weekend I will be talking Angular 2 with the Dojo. Last night I helped friend work on websockets. I would like to learn more about websockets. Definitely a popular technology. [ Day 6 of 30 ]
- 4/11/2017 not missing a day [ Day 5 of 30 ]
- 4/10/2017 Checking in! :smiley: [ Day 4 of 30 ]
- 4/9/2017 Another day, staying on track! :muscle: [ Day 3 of 30 ]
- 4/8/2017 Quit commit to keep on track. Hah! [ Day 2 of 30 ]
- 4/7/2017 I am so upset that I missed a day and have to start all over with my GitHub katas. I need to keep at this for a solid 30 days or all my work was for nothing. I will start making my updates to the top of the stack instead of scrolling to the bottom. This is getting long and I am sick of scrolling to the bottom, or jumping to the bottom. Well here I go! [ Day 1 of 30 ]

- 2/24/2017, Good Morning
- 2/25/2017, Good Morning. Going to meet Winston for :coffee:.
- 2/26/2017, Afternoon. Working on final exam for MongoDB University! Oh boy this is a challenge!
- 2/28/2017, Finished the MongoDB class! Woo Hoo! That was a bit of a challenge. Time was against me for the workload. Now I will pivot to another project. Time to put effort into shopping app. Tinkering all the time. :honeybee: -soulfire
- 3/1/2017, I got an offer I couldn't refuse while working on the "Am-Fresh" app my wife and I thought of. Boy do I like to over extend myself! 
- 3/2/2017, Tonight is an SFNode meetup. Should be fun.
- 3/6/2017, Missed a couple of days of practice and that is disappointing. I am trying to do as many days as possible using the GitHub katas. Happy Birthday! Today I am the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy answer to everything. Feels pretty good.
- 3/8/2017, Going sailing today. Open up the NativeScript page to see what it has to offer.
- 3/9/2017, Having issues installing NativeScript on my Windows 8.1 machine. pain in the arse. Most of it is installed but some last part is broken :confounded: !
- 3/10/2017, Got to love coding for this answer. I got into NativeScript when there was a breaking change from Android SDK. Android moved things around so that I was doomed to fail. Luckily there was I got an answer to my dilema from Stack Overflow! :sunglasses: :computer: :heart:
- 3/12/2017, Missed a day due to friends visiting. Taking a break today. We will see what happens. :hatching_chick::hatching_chick::hatching_chick::hatching_chick:
- 3/15/2017, Last night I watched a show called "Abstract" on Netflix and I really enjoyed it. He commented that artist should draw everyday. I agree with that. Programming is the same way for me. I need to program everyday to keep myself sharp. I also need to work harder if I find there are parts of my skill set lacking! :bowtie: :muscle: :checkered_flag:
- 3/16/2017, Tired today and woke up late. Trying hard to make my daily github update! Yay! I have almost committed! 
- 3/17/2017, Working hard to do my daily kata. Position 2 Github Kata.
- 3/18/2017, Found an organization online that calls itself CoderDojo. So funny how you get reminded that no "great" idea is unique or REALLY new. Berkeley Javascript Dojo (BJD) is not the same, nor is it inspired by CoderDojo or CodeWars. I will look into each of these more. I envision BJS as a seed that will grow into more meetups. The format is location-language-Dojo. The group will set up regular meetings. Create Katas for users to practice and improve. Create a way to communicate, we use Slack in our Dojo. Each user must participate to be considered a member of the Dojo. Membership is free because knowledge should be shared, not hoarded. There is more too it but that is all I feel like writing down at the moment.
- 3/19/2017, Realized I can't get any real coding time if I don't wake up early on the weekend. Splitting my time between family and coding takes deliberate action. Time to look into the NativeScript tutorial some more.
- 3/21/2017, Forgot to do an update yesterday. Seems like I will be sarting over again. Teaching myself a lesson. When I do 30 days in a row I will be in a good place! :muscle:
- 3/22/2017, Went to MongoDB meetup last night in San Francisco. That was fun. I got to ask questions of some of the internal team. I also met a nice guy from Aspen. Time to try some new meetups. I have been going to the same topics for awhile and they aren't as interesting as they once were. I feel like it is more marketing. I want more inspiration.
- 3/23/2017, Almost forgot to update today. I was inspired to add my notes for a politcal app on github. I figure I have 4 years of inspiration under the new administration. 
- 3/24/2017, It's Friday!!!! :star:
- 3/25/2017, I'm at the monthly BJD (Berkeley Javascript Dojo) meetup. I am on time and no one is here. 3 people said they would attend during the 4 hour block. We will see how that goes. Consistency is important for me as the host. Even if they don't show I will.
- 3/27/2017, Daily practice! I forgot to push my updates from home computer OR I forgot to do my daily katas. I thought I was on it doing my daily katas but I can't be sure. Now I am at work and there is no way to know until I get home. But this will give me a chance to see what happens when someone updates a repo and then someone else tries to update the same repo later. Hopefully Git merges the old updates with mine... not sure till I try it :smiley:
- 3/28/2017, At Working trying not to forget my Kata for the day. Last night I did some github work on multiple repos and that felt good. Looks like the practice is paying off. [ Day 2 of 30 ] :high_brightness:
- 3/29/2017, Didn't start the day coding. Waking up at 5 am shouldn't feel like cheating. Going to bed at 10 pm was the real problem. Excited to play with Angular 4 this weekend. I added some notes to the BJD github page. [ Day 3 of 30 ] :muscle:
- 3/30/2017, Geting my kata in early today. I don't want to start over. Hopefully today I will get some time to work on the BJD gitHub some more. I really want to get the bones of that up. I realized that I made a choice that is a problem. I created my notes as doc files which is not accessible to everyone. I need to convert those files into markdown. I shouldn't maintain both because that is too much work. [ Day 4 of 30 ]
- 3/31/2017, Worked on the GitHub repo. I pushed a bunch of files and empty folders to the repo. It is easier for me to work on it if I sync to the repo instead of just having it on my laptop. So much fun!! Tomorrow I need to start on Am-Fresh. [ Day 5 of 30 ] :stuck_out_tongue: :fire:
- 4/1/2017, Getting some work done on BJD github. I also made some updates to Arlen's GitIt repo. Almost forgot to make my kata post today. [ Day 6 of 30 ]
- 4/2/2017, Gotta get myself on target today. It is early and I don't have my thoughts organized yet. [ Day 7 of 30 ]
- 4/3/2017, Moving right along. Kia! [ Day 8 of 30 ]
- 4/4/2017, Practice makes perfect! I have been consumed lately with trying to understand cryptocurrency even more. There are gaps in my understanding and I am trying to fill them in so I know what the heck it is and how it all works together. It is a fun journey. I traded a little and that helped. Next on the list is to build a miner. The node and miner connection is kind of alluding me. Also pools are another thing I hear about but don't know the details of. So much to learn and understand. [ Day 9 of 30 ] :star2: :dizzy:
- 4/5/2017, works on Am-Fresh wireframes yesterday. Tonight is a Waffle.js meetup. Interested to see it because I have heard good things in the past. [ Day 10 of 30 ]
