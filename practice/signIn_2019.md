- 1/13/2019, Sunday - This is a new year with new beginings. Looking forward to a career in code. I can do this. I am doing this. I will do this. Today was the first day towards my Yellow Belt. I am working with Joel Hernandez on getting his white belt in the BJD. He did his first kata on 1/12/2019 so it is official. Day #1. I will probably post in here to keep track of his progress.
