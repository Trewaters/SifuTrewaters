- 1/14/2019, Monday - Today I wanted to sleep in but I can't. Got to remember the process. Sleeping in for me means to stay in bed past 6 am. My goal is to get up early and code before the house starts moving. On the weekends I am easier on myself because it is the weekend and I must remember to rest. Today I checked on Sifu Joel and he has another commit. Now on Day #2!
- 1/13/2019, Sunday - This is a new year with new beginings. Looking forward to a career in code. I can do this. I am doing this. I will do this. Today was the first day towards my Yellow Belt. I am working with Joel Hernandez on getting his white belt in the BJD. He did his first kata on 1/12/2019 so it is official. Day #1. I will probably post in here to keep track of his progress.
