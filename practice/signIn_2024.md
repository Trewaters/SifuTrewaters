Where to start! SO, so busy lately. Trying to make sure I am noticed for a role upgrade. I am doing Software development daily. We meet daily and I have work to deliver every 2 weeks since the end of last summer (2023). We have to deliver our first product (NDA restrictions apply) soon. I can feel the stress and work pile up. I do what I can to keep work within the 40 hours a week I am paid for. This is helping me keep my sanity.
