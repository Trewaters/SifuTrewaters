Where to start! SO, so busy lately. Trying to make sure I am noticed for a role upgrade. I am doing Software development daily. We meet daily and I have work to deliver every 2 weeks since the end of last summer (2023). We have to deliver our first product (NDA restrictions apply) soon. I can feel the stress and work pile up. I do what I can to keep work within the 40 hours a week I am paid for. This is helping me keep my sanity.

Yesterday I met with manager for our company yearly reviews. For the past year I have been working hard to prove I could code with professionals and get the job done. Unfortunately my manager gave a 1% raise and said keep up the hard work. We notice you but currently the company is having a tough time and we don't have the resources for more. That didn't sit well with me because they are hiring new employees for more than I make. I am managing two projects successfully. I would have been able to justify their response if they had even given me the title of engineer and not associate engineer. Nope they couldn't even do that.

I believe in going where I am celebrated not just tolerated. They don't celebrate me in the way I feel is right. Truly it feels like I have hit a glass ceiling. Time to polish off the resume, dust off the github repo, and do the grind.

I value myself more than they do.
