# Sign In Daily 2022

Try to code every day. My issue is I am so busy where will I find the time to code everyday? First pick the foundation. For me the foundation is JS (full stack) and python with GraphQL to manage data. Now that I picked my foundation how do I build it and build with it?

My solution is to start with doing some browser JS. While I am at work I will open the Google Chrome browser Developer Console and code live in there. I am limited what I can at work but I think it should be possible to code a little in-between calls.

Finish my python tutorials and start using it on Tezos OSS projects so I can keep that skill strong.

Not sure how to manage GraphQL yet. I will start with JS and figure out the rest as time passes. I don't have too, and I can't do it all in one day anyway!

Much Love to my Fam!

Yesterday I signed up for the Vanilla JS Academy by Chris Ferdinandi. Looking forward to reviewing some JS materials as I build my coding skills back up. I have been working a job for the past, almost, three years. I do SQL all day. Just simple queries. That is not enough for me. I stay because I need to make money but I want to work on something more fulfilling for me. This is all part of it.

Starting this journal again after a couple years. Quarantine has been a bitch I am in need of a change!

Looking forward to coding more this year. My day job is making me stupid. Or I am making myself dumber. Either way time to kick my ass into gear before my world ends.
