# Sign In Daily 2022

Yesterday I signed up for the Vanilla JS Academy by Chris Ferdinandi. Looking forward to reviewing some JS materials as I build my coding skills back up. I have been working a job for the past, almost, three years. I do SQL all day. Just simple queries. That is not enough for me. I stay because I need to make money but I want to work on something more fulfilling for me. This is all part of it.

Starting this journal again after a couple years. Quarantine has been a bitch I am in need of a change!

Looking forward to coding more this year. My day job is making me stupid. Or I am making myself dumber. Either way time to kick my ass into gear before my world ends.
