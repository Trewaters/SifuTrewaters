It has been a busy couple weeks. Loving Durango but over worked. I didn't take time to code over that period.

No coding the past couple days. We have been busy travelling but that is not excuse. I didn't prioritize coding those days. That is on me.

## Thursday, 2022-04-28 08:31:38

I turned yesterday around in the afternoon. I missed my morning window for coding so I will see what I can do on breaks. My goal is to get 15 minutes minimum to learn something new. I would like 30 minutes to an hour but that has been difficult lately. Mainly because I can't seem to prioritize that hour for myself. I am overwhelmed and under disciplined to make it happen now.

## Wednesday, 2022-04-27 08:17:05

Tuesday was a bust. I didn't do any coding yesterday. How does it feel to fail? Not great. What does failure look like? This is a small failure. I am disappointing myself. I am still employed. I have a job that pays the bills. This is my personal goal to improve my job skills. This failure feels big. I really don't like my work and want a change. I feel if I can improve my coding skills I could apply for better jobs. 

The real test of any choice is would you make it again? Yes.

I will continue to try and code more. Try to improve my work life by getting a different job. Today I pick myself up and try again. Try, try until you succeed. Even though I feel like shit now I am not going to stop trying to do better.

With love for myself I will take another step towards my dream.

Didn't start with my best foot forward today. I am not working on the JS Academy program like I want to. It comes down to the fact that I am not making the best of my time. I feel overwhelm when I have a moment to do anything. Life is hectic and I am not doing a great job of staying focused. After I miss my time doing any code then I feel bad. Seems like I should just code something to avoid that feeling.

I could use a boost of confidence if you ever want to tweet at me. It would be nice. I do better in community.

## Sunday, 2022-04-24 08:07:21

I'm up. Let's see if I get at 'em!

## Saturday, 2022-04-23 08:33:01

No coding this week. I will try to reset and see if we can turn this around. I still work in tech but I am trying to work on building my coding skills specifically so that isn't good enough for me.

## Thursday, 2022-04-21 08:23:52

Every day is a challenge. As you can tell I missed a few days. Dealing with overwhelming emotions and low energy. I have been negative with myself. I am 47 years old. I have done almost everything in software and I am still doing dumb software tech support. It is hurting my soul. The goal is to turn this around. This diary/journal is part of my therapy. As long as I keep posting here there is a chance that things will turn around.

## Monday, 2022-04-20 07:04:00

I am here... Worked on my JS practice. Still have the NFT Marketplace in the back of my mind. Once I feel more proficient with code I can work on the NFT project. I would love to start reading the Rovi NFTs and creating the community based on the NFT eco system. It is a grand project.

## Tuesday, 2022-04-19 07:46:54

Honestly not so happy that I am not coding the past couple days. Gotta get my but into gear. How can I improve this? Set a short time to focus on coding. I don't have a scheduled time now and that is making me put it off until there is no time left in my day. Since this is a priority I should treat it as such. I will code for 15 minutes everyday starting at 7am! I will do this through Friday and see how that works. Setting the alarm now.

## Thursday, 2022-04-14 07:14:01

Yesterday I started working with a NFT Marketplace template for Polygon. Looking forward to working with Rovi NFT.

## Wednesday, 2022-04-13 08:03:44

No coding yesterday and not getting it in this morning. Need to do something to jump start my coding.

## Monday, 2022-04-11 07:54:15

Rested and ready to go. I believe it is good to start the week strong.

## Sunday, 2022-04-10 09:52:26

Not going to lie. I wanted to take the weekend off. I am not "hardcore". I understand computers and software. My goal here is to sharpen my skills not dull my enthusiasm for living by over working. My Vanilla JS workshop keeps going even on... Saturday. I checked and nothing for today (Sunday). He does believe in a day of rest. I would know if I read the information closely. Honestly I just skimmed because I figure I have taken his workshop before and it is manageable. I opted to learn the details later (which is now, lol).

I wanted to address something that came to mind the other day. This log is my motivational and emotional software developers journal. I am not concerned with coding details here. I save that in the github repos or in the software comments. It would be too much for this developers diary (journal).

Moving a little slow today but still moving forward.

## Thursday, 2022-04-07 07:41:21

Good morning. I am working through the academy exercises. Nice refresher. Perfect pace for me and the time I have. Spending about 30 minutes a day on this material. Not enough to become awesome but enough to get the rust off. I want to be able to code my own solutions for other projects I have in mind like RoviAi NFT Manager.

## Wednesday, 2022-04-06 07:20:37

Another good start to the day. Keep this up and things will be great!

## Tuesday, 2022-04-05 07:50:15

So far so good. Working on my projects daily. Need to make more time for it but at least the dust is coming off!

## Monday, 2022-04-04 08:18:14

Getting started today! Woo Hoo!

## Saturday, 2022-04-02 08:32:08

Moving slow on things. JavaScript coding starts Monday the 4th and I am excited to dust off the cob webs. It is funny the gap being wanting to do a thing and actually doing that thing. For example I want to code more since two weeks ago but I am not honestly coding more. I did start using old tools and that is good, but not enough. This coding workshop will help me. I need something to work on and right now I don't have that project which is driving me. Again I have ideas for projects but none of those is driving me yet. The closest one driving me at the moment is a Rovi NFT Manager. I am pretty sure I posted my paper on it in github... Nope, I posted on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/RoviAI/comments/tio37h/rovi_leagues_role/). 

The Rovi.ai League idea gets me excited. This last week I started spending 15 minutes in the morning working on something Rovi related and that has been fun. This Rovi.ai league project will require me to code something that works in decentraland metaverse and connects to Ethereum. I don't know how to code Solidity yet but that will be part of it.

We drove from Flagstaff Arizona to Santa Fe New Mexico over the weekend. I am recording a podcast with my wife while we travel the southwest united states as digital nomads. We changed timezones and had a few things to do so I didn't get on for my logs. Next week I start Vanilla JS Academy with Chris. Looking forward to the refresher.

My friend and collaborator Berkeleytrue setup the Netlify App for my dApp AC DAO (https://acdao-dev.netlify.app/).

Today I am moving slow. See how far I get. Been working on the Rovi League design document. I believe you must plan before you build. That is what I am doing. I am planning this special metaverse NFT manager before I build it.

Try to code every day. My issue is I am so busy where will I find the time to code everyday? First pick the foundation. For me the foundation is JS (full stack) and python with GraphQL to manage data. Now that I picked my foundation how do I build it and build with it?

My solution is to start with doing some browser JS. While I am at work I will open the Google Chrome browser Developer Console and code live in there. I am limited what I can at work but I think it should be possible to code a little in-between calls.

Finish my python tutorials and start using it on Tezos OSS projects so I can keep that skill strong.

Not sure how to manage GraphQL yet. I will start with JS and figure out the rest as time passes. I don't have too, and I can't do it all in one day anyway!

Much Love to my Fam!

Yesterday I signed up for the Vanilla JS Academy by Chris Ferdinandi. Looking forward to reviewing some JS materials as I build my coding skills back up. I have been working a job for the past, almost, three years. I do SQL all day. Just simple queries. That is not enough for me. I stay because I need to make money but I want to work on something more fulfilling for me. This is all part of it.

Today posting in the afternoon on my second break from work. Each day I make an entry is a good day for me. That means that I am in the right state of mind to Manifest better employment for me! One day at a time.

Starting this journal again after a couple years. Quarantine has been a bitch I am in need of a change!

Looking forward to coding more this year. My day job is making me stupid. Or I am making myself dumber. Either way time to kick my ass into gear before my world ends.
